Spring AOP Demonstration

This project demonstrates the concept of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) using Spring Framework. AOP allows developers to separate cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, security, and transaction management, from the business logic. This approach enhances modularity and code maintainability.

Project Overview

The project consists of four main components:

1. Entity Class

Represents the core business logic. In this project, it is responsible for providing user details. The methods in this class are enhanced with logging functionality using AOP.

2. Configuration Class

Configures the Spring application. It enables component scanning to detect beans and aspects and activates AOP proxying to apply cross-cutting logic.

3. Aspect Class

Implements the logging logic. It uses Spring's AOP annotations to define advice that runs before, after, and around the execution of business methods.

4. Main Class

Serves as the entry point of the application. It initializes the Spring context, retrieves beans, and invokes methods to demonstrate the AOP functionality.

Key Annotations
1. @Component: Registers classes as Spring-managed beans.
2. @Configuration: Indicates the class is a source of Spring configuration.
3. @ComponentScan: Specifies the package to scan for Spring components.
4. @EnableAspectJAutoProxy: Activates AOP proxying in the application.
5. @Aspect: Marks a class as an aspect, enabling it to contain cross-cutting logic.
6. @Before, @After, @Around: Define advice that executes at specific join points in the application.
